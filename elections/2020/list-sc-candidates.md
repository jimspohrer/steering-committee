| Rohit Sharma        | AI Techsystems         | AITS (http://www.ai-techsystems.com) mission is to simplify AI model deployment in EDGE devices with compiler (https://github.com/ai-techsystems/dnnCompiler) and libraries (https://github.com/ai-techsystems/arduino) with ONNX as the front end. We are among few member pushing AI/ML on micro-controller with ONNX and make it adaptable to EDGE verticals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Delip Rao           | AI Foundation          | I am the VP of Research at the AI Foundation. I am also the author of a recent book on NLP and Deep Learning using PyTorch, and have been using PyTorch as a Beta user. Prior to that, I have used TensorFlow, and recently I am trying out JAX.   While I am not an explicit contributor to ONNX codebase, I recognize the potential and limitations in each of these DL ecosystems and think ONNX can play an important role in transferring capabilities across them. I am applying to be a member of this steering committee with a hope of catalyzing towards that future.                                           |
| Gurbans Chatwal     | Fiserv                 | I have been working in IT and Financial Services for the last 28 years. I did devote my initial years (1989 - 1994) in research and application of ANN and Genetic Algorithms. Today, as VP of Technology in Fiserv, I lead a team of 120 people in Intelligent Automation. I am keen to contribute to a more widespread use of cognitive technologies through Research, Application, and Standardization.  I have used ONNX before and look forward to contribute to its advancement and adoption.                                                                                                                       |
| Hansheng Tan        | Futurewei (Huawei USA) | I’m the first rep of Huawei (USA) when ONNX was originally initiated by FB/MSFT/AMZN. With years of experience in ML I’m dedicated     to the NPU development and AI innovations. The challenges of different frameworks have made developers frustrated and an universal format is desired - I believe I can contribute in this effort to make ONNX more practical and even more well supported by all devices. Today ML is just too fragmented and we can not count on a single framework like Tensor-Flow to dominate the AI world in the future. We need to grow ONNX with right strategies!                          |
| Zhipeng Huang       | Huawei                 | I have been involved with ONNX Community since its early days, co-hosted the very first ONNX China workshop with Microsoft and my team has been participating following workshops as well. My team has been also involved in the formation of the Edge WG in the past. I'm currently also serving as the LFAI TAC member and community manager for MindSpore.  I'm running for ONNX SC seat because as a long time believer in the ONNX cause, I want to help expand ONNX in new areas (training, mlir, more backend support via modelzoo CI, etc) and also build a stronger APAC developer ecosystem for ONNX community. |

| Prasanth Pulavarthi | Microsoft              | Hello! I've been involved with ONNX since it's inception. I'm currently on the Steering Committee. My GitHub handle is "prasanthpul" and you'll see me responding to GitHub issues, helping merge PRs, and answering questions on Gitter. My team at Microsoft works on many of the ONNX converters as well as ONNX Runtime. I'm excited to continue helping grow the ONNX ecosystem!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Sheng Zha           | Amazon                 | I'm a committer, PPMC member, and a main contributor of Apache MXNet project, and member of Distributed (Deep) Machine Learning Community, the community where MXNet, XGBoost, and TVM originated. Through the role of ONNX steering committee member, I hope to better align the goals of ONNX with these various ecosystems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Jim Spohrer         | IBM                    | Part of my team at IBM under the leadership of Tom Truong (jedi@us.ibm.com) is active in the converter and training working groups.  Tom also hosted the last ONNX community meeting - virtual.   I help represent and advocate for ONNX collaborations both inside IBM as well as in the Linux Foundation AI.  Both Tom and I are happy to be of more service to the community.  The demand for ONNX is only going to grow in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Joohoon Lee         | NVIDIA                 | I am AI inference SW product manager at NVIDIA. TensorRT is NVIDIA's optimizer and runtime for deep learning inference. I have been advocating adaption of the ONNX ecosystem at NVIDIA to help customers deploy their trained models. ONNX is important for NVIDIA's inference story and I helped organizing the ONNX community meeting hosted by NVIDIA in 2019. I look forward to enriching and promoting the ONNX ecosystem as a member of the steering committee.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Harry Kim           | Intel                  | Hi! I am a current member of the ONNX Steering Committee, and I have been participating in the ONNX project and community for the past couple of years. I have been an active advocate for ONNX at Intel, and I was fortunate to represent Intel's contributions to ONNX. As a Steering Committee member, I helped to create election guidelines, host workshops, and shape roadmap for ONNX. I would be excited to serve the ONNX community one more time.                                                                                                                                                               |
